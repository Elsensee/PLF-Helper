{"name":"Preislistenpfleger Helper","tagline":"A tool for users from www.preislistenpfleger.de","body":"### About\r\nBack in 2011 the user \"Wurzel Manager\" had the idea of such a tool and created it in a script for OpenOffice/LibreOffice and Microsoft Office.\r\nHowever, it was fairly limited to read the prices automatically from the clipboard and then just ordering them so the users just have to copy it into Google Spreadsheets.\r\nFor the record: http://wurzelmanager.blogger.de/topics/Preislisten-Pfleger+Tool/ (german)\r\n\r\nI liked the idea and started writing a first version. After a few problems I finally had the version 0.6.0.0 (I don't know why I started there) after 7-9 weeks completed. But version 0.6.0.0 didn't really work so it took me a few weeks more to finish version 0.7.0.0 and this worked. Finally. Mostly.\r\n\r\nShit.\r\n\r\nThen the pauses between the versions were getting longer and longer and longer.\r\n\r\nThen in August 2013 (I think) I created this GitHub repository to do a complete re-write of my standalone application. (I would also love it to do that for Linux aswell - thanks to Mono-Project)\r\nNow a few weeks ago (March 2014) I resumed my work on that and here we are!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
